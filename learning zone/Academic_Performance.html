                    Everyone is a genius in their own way. Individual strengths vary drastically from one individual to another. Comparing your grades with your classmates who do not put in much effort but still do well is a bad idea. It is a sure set way to get conquered by negative emotions. A bit of competition cannot hurt. However, improving weak subjects can significantly vary depending on your strategy to retain knowledge.

For instance, a few lucky ones are out there with a photographic memory, which lets them get straight A’s without much effort. Then some of us have to go over our notes twice for the knowledge to retain in our memory. Others remember better when they take notes. Some prefer to record their lessons and listen to them again to comprehend what was taught.

Arm yourself with effective memory aids to help you remember information. Once you find out the best way you retain knowledge, you can construct an action plan to improve academic performance.

                    Before you can make a plan of action, you need to find out which subjects or areas you need to target. The next step is to discover the areas you are underperforming and the cause. Are your grades generally lower than you’d prefer in all of your subjects? Or is there one specific area where you’re having trouble affecting your overall performance in a subject?

Try to identify a pattern. Write down your grades on paper, or draw a graph if you have to see which areas you underperform the most. Next, try to understand why you aren’t performing to your full academic potential in the areas you’ve pinpointed.

Are they external factors such as your family or other personal issues, or are you struggling with an academic skill to comprehend the subject? Once you isolate what is causing the issue, you can apply problem-solving strategies to overcome the areas you struggle with the most. If the problems are external, you might want to consider discussing them with a counsellor. If it’s academics, you can try out our suggestion #3.

                    It’s always a brilliant idea to consult your teachers or teaching assistants when devising a strategy for improving your grades. Most teachers are highly empathising and would be keen to help you do better.

                    Ask questions about the areas that you find challenging to comprehend. Get advice on strategies you can develop to do better in those areas. Teachers like to help out students who are making an effort.

                    Make sure you prioritise your time wisely and set achievable goals for yourself. We cannot emphasise enough the “achievable goals” because setting unattainable targets can be exhausting and could also be a reason you struggle.

                    When you choose to become a student, you have to learn to say no to many other things. Taking time to plan and focus on learning is a straightforward way to enhance academic performance.
                    
                    Take time to list your priorities in order of personal, professional, and academic activities. Your list must reflect your academics and time for self-care, family, and sports. Achieving your academic goals is highly dependent on how your manage your time. 
                    
                    Make a daily schedule for yourself, break your day into time slots, and leave plenty of time for studying. Allocate more time to courses or topics that you’ve recognized as being challenging.

                    When you’re studying, do so at your desk, and make sure you maintain a tidy space. Organize all of your textbooks and study materials, and remove any needless distractions like your phone, tablet, or laptop. If you must use your computer, use software such as Self Control, which will prevent you from accessing distracting social media websites.

Clutter of any type hinders our capacity to focus effectively, so getting organized is another approach to improve your academic performance.

                    There is a lot of research out there that points out thatphysical activity improves academic performance. Physical activity has a direct effect on learning and behaviour.

Research has shown that physical activity can increase the oxygen flow to the brain. It also increases the number of neurotransmitters which helps with memory, concentration, and stress management. Physical activity can also improve classroom attitudes and behaviours, which are essential in enhancing academic performance.

Nutrition plays a significant role in getting better grades. It’s not rocket science.  To learn well, you need to eat well. Healthy food gives the energy that our bodies and minds require to grow, feel positive, be active, stay fit, and learn. Therefore if you are focused on enhancing your academic performance incorporate healthy nutritional habits and exercise into your lifestyle.
